## Problem Statement
To predict the concrete mix design just by giving the model a particular **compressive strength value**.

---

## Methodology
The following machine learning models were applied and compared:

- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boost  
- CatBoost  

## Results
Among all models, **CatBoost** performed the best with:

- Highest **RÂ² Score**  
- Lowest **MAE**  
- Lowest **RMSE**
